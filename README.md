> ðŸ“Œ **Note to self**

> When Eleventy 3 becomes available as a regular release and is no longer in [alpha](https://www.zachleat.com/web/eleventy-v3-alpha/), update the `peerDependencies` of all packages from:
>
> ```txt
> "@11ty/eleventy": ">=2.0.0 || 3.0.0-alpha.4"
> ```
>
> to:
>
> ```txt
> "@11ty/eleventy": ">=3.0.0"
> ```
>
> Also, don't forget to update the GitHub workflows.

> **Note:** Eleventy supports **both** CJS and ESM [from version 3 onwards](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy/pull/3074). However, I plan to publish **only** ESM packages for my Eleventy plugins. This means that each one of my plugins should declare `>=3.0.0` in its `peerDependencies`.

Monorepo for my [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/) plugins.

> ðŸ“¦ **ESM only:**
>
> All libraries of this monorepo are published to npmjs as ECMAScript modules.

## Installation

Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone git@github.com:jackdbd/undici.git

cd undici
```

Ensure you have a Node.js version supported by this project. You can use a Node.js version manager like [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm), [asdf](https://github.com/asdf-vm/asdf-nodejs) or [volta](https://volta.sh/).

Install all dependencies from npm.js:

```sh
npm install --include dev
```

> :information_source: by passing `--include dev` we can be sure that we are installing `devDependencies` even when `NODE_ENV` is set to `production`. This is important because [we should **always**](https://youtu.be/HMM7GJC5E2o?si=RaVgw65WMOXDpHT2) set `NODE_ENV=production`.

Setup/update `./git/hooks` with [simple-git-hooks](https://github.com/toplenboren/simple-git-hooks).

```sh
npx simple-git-hooks
```

## Development

This monorepo uses [Typescript project references](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/project-references.html) to build all of its libraries.

### Packages

Build all libraries (i.e. 11ty plugins) in watch mode:

```sh
npm run dev:libs
```

You can also run `build` / `dev` / `test` on a single package. For example:

```sh
npm run build -w packages/eleventy-plugin-telegram
npm run dev -w packages/eleventy-plugin-telegram
npm run test -w packages/eleventy-plugin-telegram
```

### Demo site

> :warning: Before building the demo site, be sure to build all other packages first.

Build the demo 11ty site:

```sh
npm run build:site
```

Build all libraries and the demo site:

```sh
npm run build
```

Build all libraries and the demo site, both in watch mode, and serve the demo site with the [Eleventy dev server](https://www.11ty.dev/docs/dev-server/):

```sh
npm run dev
```

Watch only the demo site and serve it using the Eleventy dev server:

```sh
npm run dev -w packages/demo-site
```

Serve the production build of the demo site:

```sh
npm run serve -w packages/demo-site
```

## Test

Run all tests on all packages:

```sh
npm run test
```

Run tests on a single package:

```sh
npm run test -w packages/eleventy-plugin-content-security-policy

npm run test -w packages/eleventy-plugin-ensure-env-vars

npm run test -w packages/eleventy-plugin-permissions-policy

npm run test -w packages/eleventy-plugin-plausible

npm run test -w packages/eleventy-plugin-telegram

npm run test -w packages/eleventy-plugin-text-to-speech
```

## Demo

See these plugins configured for the [demo Eleventy site](./packages/demo-site/README.md) that you can find in this monorepo. Live at: https://undici.pages.dev/

## Monorepo management

For local development I rely on some environment variables and secrets. They are all set using a `.envrc` file. In my case this `.envrc` file **can** be tracked in git because the environment variables I use are non-sensitive configuration, and the secrets exist only on my filesystem. See also [nix-config](https://github.com/jackdbd/nix-config/) to learn how I encrypt my secrets.

See also [scripts](./scripts/README.md).
