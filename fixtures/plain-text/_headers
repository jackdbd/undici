# Service workers—at least in Chromium-based browsers—are invalidated in the
# HTTP cache every 24 hours, so using the Cache-Control directives no-store and
# max-age=0 is probably overkill.
# https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/+/master/docs/security/service-worker-security-faq.md#do-service-workers-live-forever
# I think it's better to err on the side of caution though. So:
# - never store the service worker in any cache (no-store), and
# - clear any existing cache responses (max-age=0)
