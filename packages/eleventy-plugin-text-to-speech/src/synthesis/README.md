# synthesis

Synthesize text to speech.

- [ElevenLabs Text to Speech](https://elevenlabs.io/docs/api-reference/text-to-speech)
- [Google Cloud Text-to-Speech](https://cloud.google.com/text-to-speech/docs/apis)

If you want to provide your own Text-to-Speech client, implement an object that has a `synthesize` method and an `extension` method. See existing clients for reference.
